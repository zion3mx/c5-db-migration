# Background #

Here at Carbon Five we have the luxury of working on many projects, so anything we can do to make things easier will pay off in multiplicity across new projects. One of the things that we have to deal with on every project is maintaining a database schema over time. We’ve had a manual process of capturing changes in incremental db patch scripts for a while, but it was error prone and sometimes neglected. We’ve been doing more Ruby on Rails work and found Rails Migrations easy to work with and a real time saver. We wanted something that would make our lives easier when working on Java projects in the same way Migrations improve Rails development. With that manifest in mind, Alon and I collaborated on a simple Java database migration framework.

During development, it’s a big deal because each engineer has two instances of the database, one for unit tests and another for running the application. We need an easy way to create a new, up-to-date database and update existing databases. Once a project has launched, it’s a big deal because we need a way to migrate a database teeming with important production data to the latest version without losing critical information.
